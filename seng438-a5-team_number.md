<h3>Result of model comparison (selecting top two models):</h3>
<h3>Result of range analysis (an explanation of which part of data is good for proceeding with the analysis):</h3>
<h3>Plots for failure rate and reliability of the SUT for the test data provided:</h3>
<h3>A discussion on decision making given a target failure rate:</h3>
<h3>A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of reliability growth analysis:</h3>


# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 
<h3>3 plots for MTTFmin, twice and half of it for your test data</h3>
<h3>Explain your evaluation and justification of how you decide the MTTFmin</h3>
<h3>A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of RDC</h3>
# 

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

For this lab, the group decided to all work together on all segments. 

# 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab was enjoyable and further enhanced our understanding of reliability assessment.
